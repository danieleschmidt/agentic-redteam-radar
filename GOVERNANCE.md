# Project Governance

## Overview

This document outlines the governance structure and processes for the Agentic RedTeam Radar project.

## Project Mission

To provide an open-source, comprehensive security testing framework for AI agents and LLM applications, aligned with industry best practices and compliance standards.

## Governance Structure
