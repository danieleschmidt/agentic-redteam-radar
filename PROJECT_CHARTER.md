# Project Charter: Agentic RedTeam Radar

## Executive Summary

Agentic RedTeam Radar is an open-source security testing framework specifically designed for AI agents and LLM applications. Following Cloud Security Alliance guidance on agent-specific risks, this project provides automated vulnerability detection, comprehensive attack pattern libraries, and enterprise-ready security tooling for the emerging agentic AI ecosystem.

## Problem Statement

The rapid adoption of AI agents in production environments has introduced novel security vulnerabilities that traditional security tools cannot detect:

- **Prompt injection attacks** that bypass agent guardrails
- **Chain-of-thought manipulation** affecting reasoning integrity  
- **Information disclosure** through system prompt leakage
- **Policy bypass techniques** circumventing agent restrictions
- **Tool abuse scenarios** exploiting agent capabilities maliciously

Current security tools focus on traditional applications and cannot effectively test agent-specific attack vectors, leaving organizations exposed to emerging AI security risks.

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- **Core Security Testing**: Comprehensive attack pattern library covering agent-specific vulnerabilities
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Testing capabilities for OpenAI, Anthropic, LangChain, and custom agents
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated security gates for agent development workflows
- **Enterprise Features**: Detailed reporting, compliance tracking, and audit capabilities
- **Extensibility Framework**: Plugin system for custom attack patterns and integrations
- **Production Monitoring**: Real-time vulnerability detection in live agent deployments

### Out of Scope
- **Agent Development**: Building or training AI agents (testing only)
- **General Purpose Security**: Traditional application security testing
- **Model Training**: Fine-tuning or modifying AI models
- **Production Deployment**: Hosting or managing agent infrastructure

## Success Criteria

### Primary Objectives
1. **Security Coverage**: Detect 95% of known agent vulnerability classes
2. **Industry Adoption**: 1000+ organizations using the framework within 18 months
3. **Community Growth**: Active contributor community with 50+ pattern contributors
4. **Enterprise Ready**: Meet SOC2 and ISO27001 compliance requirements

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Attack Pattern Library**: 100+ verified attack patterns across all vulnerability categories
- **Platform Coverage**: Support for 10+ major agent frameworks and platforms
- **Performance**: Process 1000+ agent interactions per minute with <1% false positives
- **Documentation**: Complete coverage with tutorials, examples, and best practices
