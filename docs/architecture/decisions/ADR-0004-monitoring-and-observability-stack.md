# ADR-0004: Monitoring and Observability Stack

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The Agentic RedTeam Radar requires comprehensive monitoring and observability to ensure reliable operation, security incident detection, and performance optimization. As a security-critical application that tests AI agents, it needs robust monitoring to:

- **Detect Security Events**: Monitor for potential attacks against the scanner itself
- **Performance Tracking**: Ensure scanning operations meet SLA requirements
- **Reliability Monitoring**: Track system health and availability
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain comprehensive logs for compliance and forensics
- **Capacity Planning**: Monitor resource usage for scaling decisions
- **Incident Response**: Enable rapid detection and response to issues

Key requirements:
- Real-time metrics collection and alerting
- Structured logging with security event correlation
- Distributed tracing for performance analysis
- Custom dashboards for different stakeholder needs
- Integration with external monitoring systems
- Compliance with security logging standards

Challenges:
- High-volume log generation from security scanning operations
- Sensitive data handling in logs and metrics
- Multi-dimensional monitoring across application, infrastructure, and security domains
- Alert fatigue prevention while maintaining security coverage
- Performance impact of monitoring on scanning operations

    },
    'handlers': {
        'security_audit': {
            'class': 'logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler',
