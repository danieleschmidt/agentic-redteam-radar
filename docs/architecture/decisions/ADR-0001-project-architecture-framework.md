# ADR-0001: Project Architecture Framework

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The Agentic RedTeam Radar project requires a robust, scalable, and maintainable architecture to support its mission of providing comprehensive security testing for AI agents. The project needs to handle multiple attack patterns, support various AI agent types, generate detailed reports, and integrate with existing security workflows.

Key requirements:
- Support for multiple AI agent platforms (OpenAI, Anthropic, custom agents)
- Pluggable attack pattern system for extensibility
- Scalable execution for large-scale security testing
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines and security tools
- Comprehensive reporting and analytics
- High performance and reliability for production use

The architecture must balance several concerns:
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new attack patterns and agent types
- **Performance**: Handle high-volume scanning efficiently  
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and testability
- **Security**: Secure handling of sensitive data and API keys
- **Compliance**: Meet enterprise security and audit requirements

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Monolithic Architecture
- Single Python application with all components integrated
- Direct database connections and file system access
- Synchronous processing model
- Built-in web interface and API

**Pros:**
- Simple deployment and development setup
- Lower operational complexity
- Direct communication between components
- Easier debugging and testing

**Cons:**
- Limited scalability for high-volume testing
- Difficult to scale individual components independently
- Technology lock-in to Python ecosystem
- Risk of tight coupling between components

### Option 2: Microservices Architecture
- Separate services for scanning, reporting, pattern management
- Event-driven communication via message queues
- Container-based deployment with orchestration
- API gateway for external access

**Pros:**  
- Independent scaling of components
- Technology diversity (different languages per service)
- Fault isolation and resilience
- Team autonomy for service development

**Cons:**
- Increased operational complexity
- Network latency and reliability concerns
- Data consistency challenges
- More complex debugging and testing

### Option 3: Modular Monolith (Chosen)
- Single deployable application with clear module boundaries
- Plugin-based architecture for extensibility
- Async processing for performance
- Clean separation of concerns with dependency injection

**Pros:**
- Balance of simplicity and modularity
- Easy deployment while maintaining clear boundaries
- Testable and maintainable code structure
- Path to microservices if needed later

**Cons:**
- Scaling limitations compared to microservices
- Potential for coupling if boundaries not enforced
- Single point of failure for entire application

## Decision

We will implement a **Modular Monolith** architecture with the following key characteristics:

### Core Architecture Principles
1. **Plugin-Based Extensibility**: Attack patterns and agent adapters as plugins
2. **Async Processing**: Non-blocking I/O for API calls and I/O operations
3. **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between domain, application, and infrastructure layers
4. **Configuration-Driven**: Externalized configuration for different environments
5. **API-First Design**: RESTful API with optional CLI and web interfaces

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.10+ for core development
- **Web Framework**: FastAPI for high-performance async API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data, Redis for caching
- **Task Queue**: Celery with Redis broker for background processing
- **Configuration**: Pydantic for validation and environment management
- **Testing**: pytest with async support and comprehensive test coverage
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger auto-generation with FastAPI

```

## Rationale

The modular monolith approach provides the best balance of our requirements:

### Simplicity vs. Scalability
- Single deployment simplifies operations while async processing provides scalability
- Clear module boundaries prevent coupling while keeping deployment simple
- Can evolve to microservices if scaling needs require it

### Development Velocity
- Familiar Python ecosystem and tooling for security-focused development
- FastAPI provides excellent performance with automatic documentation
- Plugin system allows parallel development of attack patterns

### Security and Compliance
- Single security boundary simplifies audit and compliance
- Centralized configuration management for secrets and API keys
- Built-in monitoring and logging for security event tracking

### Performance Characteristics
- Async I/O handles concurrent API calls to AI agents efficiently
- Background task processing prevents blocking on long-running scans
- Caching layer reduces redundant API calls and improves response times

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Fast Development**: Well-known Python ecosystem and libraries
- **Easy Deployment**: Single application with minimal operational overhead  
- **Clear Boundaries**: Module structure enforces separation of concerns
- **High Performance**: Async processing and caching optimize throughput
- **Extensible**: Plugin system allows easy addition of new patterns and agents
- **Observable**: Built-in monitoring and logging provide operational visibility
- **Testable**: Clear interfaces and dependency injection enable comprehensive testing

### Negative
- **Scaling Limitations**: Vertical scaling only, cannot scale components independently
- **Technology Lock-in**: Python-centric stack may limit some integration options
- **Single Point of Failure**: Entire application affected by any critical component failure
- **Memory Usage**: All components loaded in single process increases memory footprint

### Neutral
- **Migration Path**: Architecture supports evolution to microservices if needed
- **Team Structure**: Requires coordination but allows specialization by module
- **Operational Model**: Standard monitoring and deployment patterns apply
