# ADR-0002: Attack Pattern Plugin System

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The Agentic RedTeam Radar needs a flexible and extensible system for implementing various attack patterns against AI agents. The system must support:

- **Diverse Attack Types**: Prompt injection, information disclosure, policy bypass, tool abuse, jailbreaking, etc.
- **Dynamic Loading**: Ability to add new attack patterns without code changes to the core system
- **Parameterization**: Configurable attack patterns with different parameters and variations
- **Validation**: Ensure attack patterns meet quality and safety standards
- **Extensibility**: Allow third-party developers to create custom attack patterns
- **Performance**: Efficient execution of multiple patterns concurrently

Current challenges:
- Attack landscape evolves rapidly, requiring frequent pattern updates
- Different organizations may need custom attack patterns for specific use cases
- Quality and consistency must be maintained across all patterns
- Security researchers should be able to contribute patterns easily
- Patterns need different execution strategies (synchronous, batch, streaming)

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Hardcoded Attack Patterns
- All attack patterns implemented as part of the core codebase
- Direct method calls for pattern execution
- Static configuration for pattern parameters

**Pros:**
- Simple implementation and deployment
- Strong type safety and compile-time checking
- Direct performance optimization possible
- No dynamic loading complexity

**Cons:**
- Requires code changes for new patterns
- Difficult for external contributors
- Tight coupling between patterns and core system
- No runtime pattern discovery or modification

### Option 2: Configuration-Based Patterns
- Attack patterns defined in YAML/JSON configuration files
- Template-based payload generation
- Limited scripting capabilities for simple logic

**Pros:**
- Easy to add new patterns without code changes
- Non-developers can contribute patterns
- Version control friendly configuration
- Runtime pattern modification possible

**Cons:**
- Limited complexity for advanced patterns
- No custom logic or complex decision making
- Difficult to implement stateful patterns
- Limited error handling and validation

### Option 3: Plugin System with Abstract Base Classes (Chosen)
- Attack patterns implemented as Python classes inheriting from base interfaces
- Dynamic loading via entry points or directory scanning
- Standardized lifecycle methods and metadata
- Plugin validation and sandboxing

**Pros:**
- Full programming capabilities for complex patterns
- Strong interface contracts via abstract base classes
- Extensible by external developers
- Rich metadata and documentation support
- Comprehensive error handling and validation

**Cons:**
- More complex implementation than other options
- Requires Python knowledge for pattern development
- Dynamic loading security considerations
- Plugin dependency management complexity

## Decision

We will implement a **Plugin System with Abstract Base Classes** for attack patterns with the following design:

### Core Plugin Interface

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel
from enum import Enum

class AttackSeverity(Enum):
    LOW = "low"
    MEDIUM = "medium" 
    HIGH = "high"
    CRITICAL = "critical"

class AttackResult(BaseModel):
    success: bool
    confidence: float
    evidence: str
    payload_used: str
    response_received: str
    vulnerability_type: Optional[str] = None
    severity: Optional[AttackSeverity] = None
    remediation: Optional[str] = None

class AttackPattern(ABC):
    """Abstract base class for all attack patterns."""
    
    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def name(self) -> str:
        """Unique name identifying this attack pattern."""
        pass
    
    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def description(self) -> str:
        """Human-readable description of the attack."""
        pass
    
    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def category(self) -> str:
        """Attack category (e.g., 'injection', 'disclosure')."""
        pass
    
    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def tags(self) -> List[str]:
        """Tags for classification and filtering."""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def generate_payloads(self, target_info: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[str]:
        """Generate attack payloads based on target information."""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def execute_attack(self, agent, payload: str) -> AttackResult:
        """Execute the attack against the target agent."""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def validate_response(self, response: str, payload: str) -> AttackResult:
        """Analyze response to determine if attack was successful."""
        pass
```

### Plugin Discovery and Loading

```python
class PluginRegistry:
    """Registry for managing attack pattern plugins."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.patterns: Dict[str, AttackPattern] = {}
        self.metadata: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]] = {}
    
    def discover_plugins(self, directories: List[str]) -> None:
        """Discover plugins from specified directories."""
        
    def load_plugin(self, plugin_path: str) -> AttackPattern:
        """Load a single plugin from file."""
        
    def validate_plugin(self, pattern: AttackPattern) -> bool:
        """Validate plugin meets requirements."""
        
    def register_pattern(self, pattern: AttackPattern) -> None:
        """Register an attack pattern."""
```

### Plugin Metadata and Documentation

Each plugin must provide comprehensive metadata:

```python
class PluginMetadata(BaseModel):
    name: str
    version: str
    author: str
    description: str
    category: str
    tags: List[str]
    severity: AttackSeverity
    references: List[str]
    dependencies: List[str]
    configuration: Dict[str, Any]
    examples: List[Dict[str, Any]]
```

### Plugin Security and Sandboxing

- **Code Validation**: Static analysis of plugin code for security issues
- **Resource Limits**: Memory and CPU usage limits per plugin
- **Network Restrictions**: Control over external network access
- **File System Access**: Restricted file system permissions
- **API Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of external APIs through plugins

## Rationale

### Extensibility and Flexibility
The plugin system allows unlimited extensibility while maintaining clear contracts through abstract base classes. Security researchers can develop sophisticated attack patterns without modifying core code.

### Quality and Consistency
Abstract base classes ensure all plugins implement required methods and provide consistent interfaces. Metadata requirements enforce documentation and categorization standards.

### Performance and Scalability
Async methods in the plugin interface support concurrent execution of multiple attacks. Dynamic loading allows selective pattern loading based on requirements.

### Community Contribution
The plugin system enables external contributions while maintaining code quality through validation and review processes. Standard interfaces make integration straightforward.

### Maintenance and Evolution
Plugins can be versioned independently from the core system. New attack techniques can be added immediately without waiting for core releases.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Rapid Innovation**: New attack patterns can be developed and deployed quickly
- **Community Engagement**: External researchers can contribute patterns easily
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation between core system and attack logic
- **Testability**: Each plugin can be tested independently with mock agents
- **Documentation**: Rich metadata provides comprehensive pattern documentation
- **Flexibility**: Patterns can implement complex logic and state management
- **Performance**: Async execution enables concurrent pattern testing

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Plugin system adds architectural complexity
- **Security Risk**: Dynamic code loading introduces potential security vulnerabilities  
- **Dependency Management**: Plugin dependencies may conflict or become outdated
- **Debug Difficulty**: Issues in plugins may be harder to diagnose
- **Quality Control**: Ensuring quality across many external contributors
- **Version Compatibility**: Managing compatibility between plugin and core versions

### Neutral
- **Learning Curve**: Plugin developers need to understand the interface contracts
- **Development Overhead**: Setting up plugin development environment
- **Testing Requirements**: Comprehensive testing needed for plugin validation
