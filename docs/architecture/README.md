# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Agentic RedTeam Radar project. ADRs document important architectural decisions, their context, rationale, and consequences.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the development of a software project. They help teams:

- **Document the reasoning** behind architectural choices
- **Preserve context** for future team members
- **Track the evolution** of architectural decisions over time
- **Facilitate discussions** about architectural trade-offs
- **Avoid revisiting** already-decided questions

## ADR Format and Structure

We follow the standard ADR template with the following sections:

### Template Structure

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Decision Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-YYYY]

## Context
[Describe the issue or situation that motivates this decision]

## Considered Options
- Option 1: [Brief description]
- Option 2: [Brief description]
- Option 3: [Brief description]

## Decision
[State the decision that was made and rationale]

## Rationale
[Explain why this decision was made, including trade-offs considered]

## Consequences
[Describe the resulting context after applying the decision]

### Positive
- [Benefit 1]
- [Benefit 2]

### Negative
- [Risk or limitation 1]
- [Risk or limitation 2]

### Neutral
- [Neutral consequence 1]
- [Neutral consequence 2]

## Implementation
[Describe what needs to be done to implement this decision]

## Related Decisions
- ADR-XXXX: [Related decision]
- ADR-YYYY: [Another related decision]

## References
- [Link 1: Supporting documentation]
- [Link 2: Research or benchmarks]
```

## ADR Lifecycle

### 1. Proposal Phase
- Create ADR with "Proposed" status
- Share with team for review and discussion
- Iterate based on feedback

### 2. Decision Phase
- Team reaches consensus
- Status changes to "Accepted"
- Decision is implemented

### 3. Evolution Phase
- Monitor consequences of the decision
- Update ADR if significant learnings emerge
- May lead to deprecation or superseding

### 4. Deprecation/Superseding
- Mark as "Deprecated" if no longer relevant
- Mark as "Superseded by ADR-XXXX" if replaced by newer decision

## Numbering Convention

ADRs are numbered sequentially with zero-padding:
- ADR-0001: First decision
- ADR-0002: Second decision
- ADR-0010: Tenth decision

## When to Write an ADR

Create an ADR when making decisions about:

### Technical Architecture
- Technology stack choices (languages, frameworks, libraries)
- Data storage and persistence strategies
- API design patterns and protocols
- Security architecture and authentication methods
- Integration patterns and communication protocols

### System Design
- High-level system architecture
- Component boundaries and responsibilities
- Scalability and performance strategies
- Deployment and infrastructure patterns
- Monitoring and observability approaches

### Process and Tooling
- Development workflow and branching strategies
- Testing strategies and quality gates
- CI/CD pipeline design
- Code review and approval processes
- Documentation standards and tools

### Quality Attributes
- Performance requirements and trade-offs
- Security requirements and measures
- Reliability and availability targets
- Maintainability and technical debt management
- Usability and accessibility considerations

## ADR Review Process

### Before Creating an ADR
1. **Research** existing solutions and alternatives
2. **Gather requirements** from stakeholders
3. **Consider constraints** (technical, business, regulatory)
4. **Evaluate trade-offs** between options

### ADR Review Checklist
- [ ] Problem statement is clear and well-defined
- [ ] Multiple options are considered and evaluated
- [ ] Decision rationale is well-reasoned
- [ ] Consequences (positive and negative) are identified
- [ ] Implementation approach is outlined
- [ ] Related decisions are referenced
- [ ] Status is appropriate
- [ ] Writing is clear and accessible to team members

### Review Participants
- **Required**: Technical lead, affected team members
- **Optional**: Stakeholders, domain experts, security team
- **Final Approval**: Architecture review board or tech lead

## ADR Tools and Integration

### Documentation Tools
- **Format**: Markdown files in Git repository
- **Naming**: `ADR-XXXX-title-in-kebab-case.md`
- **Location**: `docs/architecture/decisions/`
- **Linking**: Cross-reference related ADRs and documentation

### Change Management
- **Version Control**: Track changes through Git commits
- **Change Log**: Maintain change history within each ADR
- **Notifications**: Use PR reviews to notify stakeholders
- **Search**: Use Git grep and documentation search to find relevant ADRs

### Integration with Development
- **Code Comments**: Reference relevant ADRs in code
- **PR Templates**: Include ADR checklist in PR templates
- **Architecture Reviews**: Use ADRs as input for architecture reviews
- **Onboarding**: Include ADR review in new team member onboarding

## ADR Governance

### Ownership and Maintenance
- **ADR Custodian**: Technical lead or designated architecture owner
- **Regular Reviews**: Quarterly review of all ADRs for relevance
- **Cleanup**: Archive or deprecate outdated ADRs
- **Quality**: Ensure ADRs remain accurate and useful

### Decision Authority
- **Technical Decisions**: Development team and technical lead
- **Business Impact**: Include product and business stakeholders
- **Security Decisions**: Include security team review
- **Infrastructure**: Include DevOps and infrastructure team

### Communication and Training
- **Team Training**: Regular sessions on ADR writing and review
- **Documentation**: Maintain this guide and update as needed
- **Examples**: Provide good and bad examples of ADRs
- **Tools**: Provide templates and tools to simplify ADR creation

## Contributing to ADRs

### For Team Members
1. **Identify Decision**: Recognize when an ADR is needed
2. **Research**: Investigate options and gather requirements
3. **Draft ADR**: Use the template and follow the guidelines
4. **Review**: Get feedback from relevant stakeholders
5. **Finalize**: Update status and implement decision

### For Reviewers
1. **Understand Context**: Read background and related ADRs
2. **Evaluate Options**: Consider if all viable options are included
